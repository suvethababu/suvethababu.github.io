      <description>Introduction:
I chose two datasets, one with data on public spending on education per child in each state and another describing minimum wage in the US by state. I thought it would be interesting to study the state-by-state differences in educational spending as I work with children in the education field and hope to go into research regarding children as well. I also believe there will be a relation between the minimum wage of each state and the amount of money they spend for public education per child as states that do not have higher levels spending for wage may also not be willing to spend more toward education.</description>
